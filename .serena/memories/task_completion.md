# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure client linting (`cd client && npm run lint`) passes.
- Run relevant Jest tests (`cd client && npm test`, or targeted suites for touched areas).
- For server-impacting changes, run manual verification or add/update tests.
- Confirm no secret keys or generated artifacts (e.g., push packages) are committed.
- Provide concise summary, test evidence, and next steps when handing off changes.
