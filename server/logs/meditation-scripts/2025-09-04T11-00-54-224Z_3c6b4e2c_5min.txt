----------------------
Welcome, XJ. Take a moment to gently settle into your space. Find a posture that feels both comfortable and alert, whether you are sitting upright or lying down. [PAUSE=7s] Allow your eyes to gently close, or if you prefer, soften your gaze towards the floor. [PAUSE=5s] Now, bring your awareness to your breath. Take a deep, full inhale through your nose, feeling your lungs expand fully, and then slowly release the breath through your mouth, letting go of any physical tension you might be holding. [PAUSE=10s] Continue to breathe naturally, simply noticing the gentle rhythm of your own breath, the subtle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. Let each breath deepen your sense of presence here and now. [PAUSE=10s]

As you rest in this awareness, gently bring to mind the image of "Grandma's Golden Days." Recall the warmth, the gentle joy, the laughter shared with your grandma and cousins. Feel the strength of those intergenerational bonds and the comfort found in shared love. [PAUSE=15s] Notice how these cherished family memories resonate with your value of kindness and your mission to do good, reminding you of the inherent goodness present in connection. [PAUSE=10s] Now, shift your focus to the simple bliss of "Calbee's Sunny Car Bliss." Picture Calbee, nestled contentedly, bathed in sunlight. Feel the quiet joy, the peace of companionship in that shared moment. [PAUSE=15s] This image speaks to the simple, authentic joys of life, reflecting your values of authenticity and your capacity for kindness in everyday interactions. Recognize these moments as foundations for your personal growth and impact. [PAUSE=10s]

Now, let us extend this feeling of warmth, kindness, and goodwill. Begin by directing this loving energy towards yourself, XJ, acknowledging your own being.
May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be free from suffering. May I find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Next, bring to mind your beloved grandma and your cousins. See their faces, feel their presence, and send them your heartfelt wishes.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Extend this warmth now to Calbee. Picture your companion, vibrant and content, and offer these wishes.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Finally, broaden this circle of kindness beyond your immediate connections. Think of all the people you encounter daily, those in your community, and then expand your awareness to include all beings across the world. In doing so, you are actively living your mission to do good and create positive impact.
May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be free from suffering. May all beings find peace and joy. [PAUSE=20s]

Gently release these phrases and return your awareness to your breath, feeling the steady anchor of this present moment. [PAUSE=7s] Carry this sense of peace, grounded in kindness and authenticity, with you. You are now recharged, ready to move forward with a renewed spirit, continuing your journey of growth, excellence, and impact, guided by your mission to do good. When you feel ready, slowly open your eyes, bringing a soft awareness back to your surroundings. Take your time.
