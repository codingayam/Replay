----------------------
Hello XJ. Take a moment to settle in, finding a comfortable position where you can feel both supported and at ease. Allow your eyes to gently close, or soften your gaze downwards. [PAUSE=5s]
Bring your awareness to your breath. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. There's no need to change anything, simply notice the natural rhythm that sustains you. [PAUSE=7s]
As you breathe, imagine a sense of spaciousness opening within you, a quiet sanctuary where you can reflect on the moments that have shaped your recent experience.

Recently, you've been pondering deep insights. Rick Rubin spoke of the universe as a muse, a wellspring of good ideas accessible through openness and belief. This resonates with your desire for Growth and Impact, reminding you that innovation and doing good often begin with a receptive heart and mind. [PAUSE=10s]
You also reflected on Masa Hero Sakurai’s wisdom, focusing on the essence of 'why is it fun' rather than just 'what it is'. This speaks to your value of Excellence and your mission to do good, encouraging a deeper understanding of joy and purpose in your own work, like building your meditation app. [PAUSE=10s]
And in between these profound thoughts, there was the simple bliss of Calbee in the sunny car, a moment of pure companionship and quiet joy. And the comforting rhythm of your favorite noodle stall, a place that feels like home, evoking a sense of community and simple connection. These moments embody Kindness and Authenticity, reminding you of the beauty in everyday life and the relationships that nourish you. [PAUSE=15s]
These threads – openness to inspiration, seeking the essence of joy, cherishing simple connections, and feeling at home – weave into your life mission to do good, guiding your path as you build, grow, and seek your life's work.

Now, let's extend this awareness and appreciation into a practice of loving-kindness.
Begin by bringing yourself to mind, XJ. Acknowledge your dedication, your pursuit of growth and excellence, and your heartfelt mission. Silently repeat these phrases for yourself:
May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be free from suffering. May I find peace and joy. [PAUSE=10s]

Next, bring to mind Calbee, your beloved companion, nestled happily in the car. Feel the warmth of that connection.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy. [PAUSE=10s]

Now, let's extend our loving-kindness to those you encountered or learned from. The diligent elderly woman at the noodle stall, quietly creating a sense of home for others. Or figures like Rick Rubin and Masa Hero Sakurai, whose insights inspire your journey towards impact and excellence. Imagine them, and offer these wishes:
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Finally, bring to mind the very process of what you are working on and seeking – building your meditation app, and finding your life's work that aligns so deeply with your values and mission. This journey, with its challenges and its promise.
May this path be happy. May it be healthy. May it be free from suffering. May it bring forth peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

As we draw to a close, gently bring your awareness back to your breath, and to the sensations of your body resting. Carry this sense of openness, insight, and loving-kindness with you. Know that you are deeply connected to your values and mission.
When you feel ready, slowly open your eyes, returning to the present moment, refreshed and recharged.
