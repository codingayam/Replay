----------------------
Welcome, XJ. Take a comfortable seat, or lie down, whatever feels most easeful for you right now. Allow your eyes to gently close, or soften your gaze downwards. [PAUSE=5s]
Let’s take a few moments to simply arrive. Notice the gentle rhythm of your breath as it flows in and out of your body. No need to change anything, just observe. Feel the support of the ground beneath you, the air on your skin. Allow any tension to begin to soften. [PAUSE=10s]

As you rest here, bring to mind the journey you are on, building this meditation app, and your quest to find work that deeply aligns with your values and mission. [PAUSE=5s]
You’ve been contemplating the nature of reward for your effort, especially when feedback isn't immediate, or when rewards are far down the line. Remember your own insight: progress itself can be the reward. The small victories – a feature working, a step forward, a line of code completed – these are moments to be recognized. [PAUSE=10s]
Acknowledge the wisdom in seeing how far you’ve come. Allow yourself to feel the genuine satisfaction that arises from taking those incremental steps, knowing that each one contributes to your larger mission to do good. [PAUSE=10s]

Now, gently bring to mind those moments when progress isn't clear, when setbacks arise, and the feeling of not being quite ready to pick up the sword again. You've recognized the emotional truth of this experience, perhaps even a sense of envy. [PAUSE=5s]
It takes courage and authenticity to acknowledge these feelings. Understand that it is natural to hope for reward at the end of a journey, and equally natural to feel that pull back when it doesn’t immediately appear. [PAUSE=10s]
Connect this to your values of growth and authenticity. This path, with its ups and downs, is a profound journey of growth. Each challenge, each hesitation, is an invitation to deepen your understanding and to continue with kindness towards yourself. Your mission to do good is a powerful anchor, a deep 'why' that sustains you through these cycles. [PAUSE=15s]

Now, let’s extend some loving-kindness, starting with yourself, XJ. Bring to mind your own being, your efforts, your hopes, and your challenges. Repeat these phrases silently to yourself:
May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be free from suffering, especially the discomfort of uncertainty and the sting of envy. May I find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Next, bring to mind those who support you on this journey – your loved ones, your community, anyone who believes in your mission. Send them your warmth and good wishes:
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy. [PAUSE=15s]

Now, extend your kindness to the experiences themselves – to the moments of setback, the feelings of not being ready to pick up the sword, and even the pang of envy you've explored. These are parts of the human experience, and we meet them with compassion.
May these challenging experiences, and all involved in them, be met with understanding. May they be happy. May they be healthy. May they be free from suffering. May they find peace and joy. [PAUSE=20s]

Finally, broaden your awareness to the grand endeavors you are undertaking – the building of your meditation app, the search for your life's work. May this path be blessed with clarity and purpose.
May these aspirations, and all who benefit from them, be happy. May they be healthy. May they be free from suffering. May they find peace and joy. [PAUSE=20s]

Allow these feelings of kindness and understanding to gently settle within you. Notice the lightness, the spaciousness that may have opened up. [PAUSE=5s]
As you prepare to bring your attention back, carry this sense of quiet reflection and gentle perseverance with you. Remember that every step, every insight, is part of your profound journey. Take a deep breath in, and exhale slowly. When you are ready, gently open your eyes or lift your gaze.
