----------------------
Welcome, XJ. Take a moment to settle into your space, finding a comfortable position, whether seated or lying down. Gently close your eyes or soften your gaze.

Let's begin by noticing your breath. Without needing to change anything, simply observe the natural rhythm of your inhale and exhale. Feel the subtle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. Allow each breath to gently ground you in this present moment.
[PAUSE=10s]

Today, we'll reflect on a fascinating insight from Masahiro Sakurai, about the counterintuitive feelings of anxiety in victory and relief in defeat within competitive games. Consider how often a "win" can bring a subtle undercurrent of pressure or the anticipation of future challenges, while a "loss" might release you from the chase, offering a moment of certainty or a chance to reset.
[PAUSE=15s]

As you reflect on this, think about your own journey. You're building a meditation app, striving for excellence and impact, and seeking your life's work, dedicated to doing good. How might this dynamic of victory and defeat, anxiety and relief, play out in your own endeavors?
[PAUSE=15s]

Perhaps a success in your app development brings the anxiety of what's next, the need to maintain momentum, or the pressure to exceed expectations. Or maybe a setback, a moment of "defeat," unexpectedly offers clarity, a moment of relief from a path that wasn't quite right, providing space for growth and an authentic redirection.
[PAUSE=20s]

Notice any physical sensations or emotions that arise as you consider these possibilities. There's no need to judge them, just to observe. This understanding can deepen your impact, allowing you to navigate the complexities of striving and achieving, not just in games, but in your life's mission to do good.
[PAUSE=15s]

Now, let’s extend some kindness to ourselves and to these experiences.

Begin by bringing yourself to mind. Acknowledge your dedication, your values of growth, kindness, authenticity, excellence, and impact.
May I be happy.
May I be healthy.
May I be free from suffering.
May I find peace and joy in navigating both victory and defeat.
[PAUSE=15s]

Next, bring to mind those you care about, perhaps individuals who are also striving, experiencing their own victories and defeats.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be free from suffering.
May you find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=15s]

Now, consider those who might represent the "opponents" or the "challenges" in your path – whether they are competitive forces in your work, or simply the very complex emotions of anxiety and relief themselves. Even these deserve a moment of understanding and kindness.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be free from suffering.
May you find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=20s]

Finally, extend these wishes to the challenging situations themselves – the competitive landscapes, the moments of uncertainty in finding your life’s work, or the intricate dance between expected and unexpected feelings that arise.
May these situations be met with wisdom.
May they lead to growth and understanding.
May all beings involved find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=15s]

As we close this session, take one last deep breath, feeling centered and grounded. Carry this nuanced understanding of success and challenge with you. You are ready to gently transition back into your day, refreshed and ready for what comes next.
