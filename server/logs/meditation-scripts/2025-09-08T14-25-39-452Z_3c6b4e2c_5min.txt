----------------------
Welcome, XJ. Take a moment to find a comfortable position, allowing your body to settle and your breath to find its own natural rhythm. Close your eyes gently, or soften your gaze downwards.
[PAUSE=5s]
Allow your awareness to rest within you, noticing the quiet hum of your own presence.
[PAUSE=7s]

You've been deeply contemplating the journey of effort and reward, how progress unfolds, and the emotional landscape of setbacks. You've recognized the intricate dance between our desire for immediate gratification and the reality of deferred rewards, or sometimes, no immediate reward at all.
[PAUSE=7s]
There's a wisdom in acknowledging that life's path is not always linear, unlike the clear feedback loops of a game. You are learning to see progress itself as a reward, valuing the small victories—the features that work, the sub-tasks completed—as milestones along the way.
[PAUSE=10s]

Your commitment to growth shines through, as you seek to redefine what 'reward' truly means, embracing experience as a teacher. And your insights into the emotional resistance to 'picking up the sword again' after a setback, or the challenging feeling of envy, speak to a deep authenticity.
[PAUSE=10s]
This entire journey, including the building of your meditation app and finding your life's work, is a testament to your mission to do good, to make an impact. It is a path of excellence, guided by kindness towards yourself and others in moments of struggle.
[PAUSE=7s]

Now, let us bring gentle awareness to this space. As we navigate these profound questions, let's cultivate a sense of loving-kindness, starting with ourselves.
XJ, may you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=10s]

Now, extend this kindness to those who support you on your journey, those who champion your mission and your efforts to do good.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=10s]

And as you navigate the complexities of life, sometimes encountering feelings of envy, or perceiving others as being further along, let us extend compassion to those who might inadvertently trigger such feelings within us, and to the feelings themselves.
May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be free from suffering. May you find peace and joy.
[PAUSE=10s]

Finally, let us embrace the journey itself—the setbacks, the non-linear path, the deferred rewards, the arena where you courageously pick up your sword. Send kindness to this entire process.
May this path be clear. May it be filled with insight. May it lead to peace and joy. May it allow you to do good.
[PAUSE=10s]

As we conclude this session, carry with you the understanding that every step of progress, every moment of self-awareness, and every act of kindness towards yourself and the journey, is a reward in itself. Allow yourself to gently re-engage with your day, feeling refreshed and re-centered, ready to continue your meaningful work.
