----------------------
Welcome, XJ. Take a moment to gently settle into your space.

Find a comfortable position, allowing your shoulders to soften, your jaw to relax. Feel the support beneath you.

[PAUSE=5s]

Now, bring your awareness to your breath. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. There's no need to change anything, simply observe this natural rhythm.

[PAUSE=10s]

As you rest in this moment, let's turn our attention to a recent experience, a simple yet profound scene at your favorite soy chicken noodle store. Recall the feeling of being at home there.

[PAUSE=7s]

Bring to mind the image of the elderly woman, focused and diligent, preparing food. Notice her quiet concentration, the steady rhythm of her work. This simple act of creation, of providing nourishment, embodies a quiet resilience.

[PAUSE=15s]

Consider how this dedication, this excellence in a simple task, resonates with your own values of growth and excellence. How does her quiet impact, the good she does by serving her community, connect with your life mission to do good?

[PAUSE=15s]

In that bustling urban setting, with its constant movement, there was an underlying sense of community, of connection. Reflect on how these moments of work and connection, of authenticity and kindness, show up in your life, perhaps even in your journey of building your meditation app or finding your life's work.

[PAUSE=20s]

Now, let's extend this sense of warmth and connection through a loving-kindness practice.

Begin by bringing yourself to mind, XJ. As you embark on building your app, and seeking your life's mission, offer yourself these wishes:
May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be free from suffering, may I find peace and joy.

[PAUSE=10s]

Next, bring to mind those you cherish, your loved ones. Perhaps like the image of the younger adult cradling a child at a nearby table in that scene, or anyone who brings comfort and warmth to your heart. Send them these wishes:
May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from suffering, may you find peace and joy.

[PAUSE=15s]

Now, broaden your awareness to others. Think of the elderly woman at the noodle stall, or the other people in that bustling scene, even the small bird patiently waiting. For these individuals, present in the everyday fabric of life, offer them these wishes:
May you be happy, may you be healthy, may you be free from suffering, may you find peace and joy.

[PAUSE=15s]

Finally, extend your loving-kindness to any challenging situations, or the wider world around you, like the vibrant, sometimes overwhelming, urban setting. For any difficulties you or others might face, or even the uncertainties in your own path to growth and impact:
May there be peace, may there be freedom from suffering, may there be joy.

[PAUSE=15s]

Gently bring your awareness back to your breath, and the feeling of your body. Carry this feeling of connection, of kindness, and of peace with you as you gently prepare to emerge, feeling rested and recharged.
