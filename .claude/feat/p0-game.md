How to gamify this system? 

1. Start with 1-min (easy mode) - add 1 entry and do 1 min of meditation/reflection. Medium mode: 5 mins; Hard mode: 10 mins. Any mode after Hard?
-- Can only progress beyond easy mode when 7 sessions within 10 days; can progress beyond medium mode when no. of sessions within x days;
2. How to provide the dopamine hit
-- When 1st session complete (banner + sounds)
-- Streak... 
-- Ranks/Tiering

3. What if it's a generation of report/profile similar to principlesyou/enneasgram only if they meet certain criteria.. and once they fail no more.. or a shorter report.. 
coaching assessments (like PLQ)...

4. Earn points and with a way to spend those points? - meditation pillow? Can throw in some super sexy/expensive item.. but hard to earn. Other possible rewards: Points, exp, $, skill points.
