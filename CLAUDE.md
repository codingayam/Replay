# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Client (React + Vite + TypeScript)
Located in `client/` directory:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript compilation then Vite build)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Server (Node.js + Express)
Located in `server/` directory:
- `node server.js` - Start production server
- `nodemon server.js` - Start development server with auto-restart (requires nodemon to be installed)
- Server runs on port 3001 by default

## Rules
- Before you do any work, MUST view files in .claude/tasks/discussion_<issue>.md file to get the full context (<issue> being the issue we are working on. If the file doesn’t exist, then create one)
- .claude/tasks/discussion_<issue>.md should contain most of context of what we did, overall plan, and sub agents will continusly add context to the file
- After you finish the work, MUST update the .claude/tasks/discussion_<issue>.md file to make sure others can get full context of what you did

### Sub-agents
You have access to multiple sub-agents:
Sub-agents will do research about the implementation, but you will do the actual implementation;
When passing task to sub-agent, make sure you pass the context file, e.g. ‘.claude/tasks/discussion_<issue>.md’,
After each sub-agent finish the work, make sure you read the related documentation generated by the sub-agent to get the update before you start executing

### Deployment Options

#### Local Development
1. Start server: `cd server && node server.js`
2. Start client: `cd client && npm run dev`
3. Access at `http://localhost:5173` (client dev server proxies API calls to localhost:3001)

#### Cloudflared Tunnel (External Access)
1. Start server: `cd server && node server.js`
2. Run tunnel: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3001`
3. Access via the cloudflared URL provided (serves both frontend build and API)
4. Note: For cloudflared, build the client first: `cd client && npm run build`

## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure
This is a full-stack reflection and journaling application called "Replay" with:
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite client application with bottom tab navigation
- **Backend**: Node.js Express server with Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT authentication and multi-user support
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for audio files, images, and profile pictures
- **AI Integration**: Uses Google Gemini for transcription/content generation and Replicate for text-to-speech

### Core Features
1. **Multi-User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login via Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
2. **User Onboarding**: 3-step onboarding flow for new users (name, values, mission)
3. **Audio & Photo Journaling**: Record daily voice notes or upload photos with captions, both transcribed and titled automatically
4. **Note Categorization**: Automatic categorization of notes into ideas or feelings
5. **Reflection Generation**: Creates personalized guided meditations from selected experiences using AI
6. **Profile Management**: User-specific profiles with values, mission, and profile picture upload
7. **Experience Tracking**: Timeline view of both audio and photo-based experiences with category badges
8. **User Data Isolation**: Complete data separation between users with Row Level Security

- **Authentication**: All API routes protected with custom Supabase `requireAuth()` middleware
- **API Routes** (all require authentication):
  - `GET /api/auth/test` - Test authentication middleware (returns user info)

### AI Workflow
1. **Audio Note Creation**: Audio upload → Gemini transcription → Gemini title generation
2. **Photo Note Creation**: Image upload + caption → Gemini enhanced description → Gemini title generation
3. **Reflection Generation**: Selected experiences + profile + date range → Gemini reflection summary → Gemini meditation script → Replicate TTS → Audio playlist with speech/pause segments

### Environment Variables Required

#### Server Environment (`server/.env`)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Generative AI API key for transcription and content generation
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` - Replicate API token for TTS (text-to-speech generation)
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key (public)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (private, for server operations)
- `PORT` - Server port (defaults to 3001)

Note: OpenAI API key is NOT required - the app uses Replicate for TTS instead

#### Client Environment (`client/.env`)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL for client-side operations
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key for client-side authentication
- `VITE_API_URL` - API base URL (http://localhost:3001 for local development)

### Data Flow
All data is user-specific and isolated by `user_id` (Supabase Auth UUID). Notes support both audio and photo types with fields: id, user_id, title, transcript (transcription for audio, enhanced caption for photos), date, type ('audio'|'photo'), audioUrl (Supabase Storage URLs), imageUrl (Supabase Storage URLs), originalCaption (photo only). User profiles contain id, user_id, name, values, mission, and profile_image_url. Meditations are linked to users and reference their noteIds with playlists containing speech segments (Supabase Storage audio URLs) and pause segments (durations).

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, React Router DOM, Lucide React icons, Axios
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT tokens, email/password authentication, user management)
- **Backend**: Express 4, Multer (file uploads), UUID, CORS, dotenv, WAV processing, Helmet (security), rate limiting
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (audio files, images, profile pictures) with signed URLs
- **AI**: Google Generative AI (Gemini models), Replicate (TTS)
### Database Schema
The application uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following tables:
- **profiles**: User profiles (id, user_id, name, values, mission, profile_image_url, timestamps)
- **notes**: User notes (id, user_id, title, transcript, category, type, date, duration, audio_url, image_url, original_caption, timestamps)  
- **meditations**: User meditations (id, user_id, title, playlist, note_ids, script, duration, summary, time_of_reflection, timestamps)

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for user data isolation using `auth.uid()`.
